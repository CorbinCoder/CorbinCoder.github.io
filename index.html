                        <h2>Background:</h2>

                            <p> My background, in very short, has predominantly been in the Hospitality and
                                Tourism sector. Ive had many different positions in the industry including
                                waiter, bartender, barista, event coordinator, various management positions etc.
                                eventually earning the privilege to develop, open and run venues for others.
                                This allowed me to meet countless people, make great connections, offer a space
                                for a community to gather and most importantly create somewhere for people to
                                have a good time.
                                I love to play guitar and sing and it’s something I try to do every day.
                                My other interests are cooking, gaming, exercising, reading/learning and
                                involving myself in politics and social commentary.
                                In terms of IT, my experience is fairly general, with minimal advanced knowledge
                                in a few areas. I have also learnt some Python, but not a great deal.</p>

                        <h2>Interest in IT:</h2>

                            <p>Well, IT has always been a part of my life. It would be less accurate to say I
                                am glad to have IT in my life than that I have never lived without it. It’s like
                                water, or food. Though there are definitely key moments that I remember IT
                                having an impact on me. Computer games are a given and I have played countless
                                great games, so I don’t find it necessary to mention that.
                                Otherwise the most memorable would be when I first downloaded MSN messenger…
                                I was a kid in country Victoria. I lived on a Dairy Farm/Horse Stud and the
                                closest town to us was a forty-five-minute drive away, so we definitely weren’t
                                making that trip very often. The population was also about 3000 people so there
                                wasn’t really much to do there anyway. All of a sudden MSN was on the block. I
                                could talk to my friends from home now. This was revolutionary!
                                It was all I did for months. Granted, the internet was terrible, and I would
                                have to log off whenever someone wanted to use the phone, but it was still
                                amazing. Then Omegle came. Then Limewire. Then Bebo (remember Bebo), MySpace,
                                Facebook, flash games, so much.
                                From then on, it’s quite difficult to pinpoint notable moments. It’s as if from
                                then on everything new was “expected” or commonplace, not progressive. I don’t
                                even really remember when face-filters became a thing. Or Tik Tok.</p>

                        <h2>Why did you choose RMIT:</h2>

                            <p>I decided to come to RMIT because further schooling was always something I had
                                wanted to do. I didn't know exactly know what I wanted to study and I wasn't
                                prepared to commit to something if I was certain it was right for me.
                                I had applied for a Bachelor of Science, got accepted and had to defer. In the
                                meantime, COVID-19 happened and I started a short course to learn to code in
                                Python, which I really enjoyed. It also gave me time to reflect and I realised
                                technology, where it’s headed and what it means for us, is something I am
                                legitimately interested and could see myself doing every day as a career.</p>

                        <h2>What do you expect to gain from your studies:</h2>

                            <p>During my studies I expect to gain a fundamental understanding of IT and be
                                in a good position to move on to the next step. I would eventually like to have
                                a very good understanding of IT, by the end of this course.</p>

                        <h1>Ideal Job: </h1>
                            <h2>Systems Manager - <a href=https://www.seek.com.au/job/50244575?type=standout#searchRequestToken=129d73bd-758c-489d-b7d1-264d2317f646 target="_blank">seek.com.au</a></h2>
                            <div id="jobPhoto"><img src="JobDescription.jpg" alt="Corbin Peever's Job Description" height="600" width="600"></div>
                                <p> Systems Managers are responsible for managing a team of Systems Engineers to
                                    plan, design, install, maintain and support Information and Communication
                                    equipment for companies usually networks, servers etc.<br>
                                    So far, I have very little experience in IT, just what I have received from
                                    this course so far and a small amount beforehand so it is difficult to make a
                                    choice with confidence. What I can do though is make a prediction by what
                                    interests me, what experience I do have and who I am as a person.
                                    So, while still being somewhat tentative, Systems Manager appeals to me. It
                                    involves all of the things I am interested in so far and I could see it as being
                                    realistic.<br><br></p>

                                <h3> My main interests in this role are:</h3>
                                <p>  - Hardware and Software related installation, management and support. This
                                    appeals to me because I would like to have an understanding of as many aspects
                                    of computing as I can. It also seems rewarding to see an entire project through
                                    from its first idea to eventual day-to-day operation.<br>
                                    - Differing job tasks. I would prefer to not do the same thing day in and day
                                    out. I have proven to myself that I flourish in environments where I can
                                    challenge myself with many different types of tasks. I also prefer to work on
                                    multiple things at the same time.<br></p>

                	              <p> - It involves leadership, especially upon promotion. I’ve worked in leadership
                                    roles for almost ten years but, I’ve never explicitly set out to achieve it. I
                                    enjoy leading people and creating positive environments for them where they can
                                    be challenged, treated with respect and able to grow and I tend to fall into
                                    these roles by the choice of my peers rather than myself, so it seems to be
                                    win-win to me. Even though I am currently in one, I no longer have a drive to
                                    work in a leadership role in my current industry, but this is more to do with
                                    the industry itself.<br></p>

                                <p> - I have a strong desire to help people. A systems manager certainly isn’t
                                    considered to be in the realm of philanthropy, but it would put me in a great
                                    position to leverage myself into something that would benefit others. I have too
                                    many vague ideas of what that looks like to describe something specifically. And
                                    this assignment would take you (and me) much too long.<br>

                                <p> - It’s lucrative and in line with my aspirations. Even though the content
                                    itself interests me, I have goals and I would like to eventually end up creating
                                    something of myself financially. Financial independence (from and employer, not
                                    my parents. That ship sailed a while ago, thankfully) has always been a priority
                                    for me and this is my way of getting there. One day.<br></p>

                                <p> - Career scalability is something I am also looking for in my future career.
                                    I don’t want to be held back by a glass ceiling but, IT being such a booning
                                    industry, I don’t expect I will ever face that issue.<br><br></p>

                                <p> At this point in time and with the knowledge I have, that would be my choice.
                                    I understand the process to get there is long and I have laid out a few key
                                    things I will have to do to get there:<br><br></p>

                                <p> - Start small. There is no way I’m going to get there over-night. Everyone
                                    starts somewhere. There seem to be a lot of “Graduate Developer” or “Junior
                                    Network and Systems Administrator” jobs available (seek.com, 2020) for people
                                    who have just finished, or have almost finished, their degree. These positions
                                    quite often are only two or three days a week so I wouldn’t need to “jump off
                                    the deep-end” per se.<br></p>

                                <p> - Scale up. With more experience comes more opportunity. Eventually, I would
                                    like to work full-time in IT and will need to take the next step. There are many
                                    jobs that I could do to achieve this, but a good example would be an Information
                                    and Communication Technology Officer role. It seems to be a good step after
                                    achieving my degree and working in a junior or graduate-type position for at
                                    least six months as it involves more difficult tasks and starts to involve
                                    implementation of systems usually under less supervision.<br></p>

                                <p> - Aim High. If I’m going to eventually get to a Systems Manager role, I will
                                    need a lot of experience in a position that will translate easily to the
                                    Managerial position. This is why, in my opinion, Systems Engineer would be
                                    perfect. They work directly under supervision of a Systems Manager enabling me
                                    to understand what is required of a staff member being led by them and to see
                                    someone in a comparable role in action.<br></p>

                    <article>
                        <h2>What do these results mean for you?</h2>

                            <p>Well, that was certainly interesting. My three selected Tests
                            gave me an opportunity to peer into my personality with more depth than
                            I had beforehand. The main points that I got from these tests is that I am
                            really good at thriving in communities and large numbers of people. I am
                            genuinely interested in people and love the dynamic created by a large group.</p>

                        <h2>How do you think these results will influence your behaviour in a team?</h2>

                            <p>I think this has certainly shown me that I need to trust my judgement better
                                in team situations. I t has given me a sense of I am in fact able to make good
                                calls, better than some at times, and I should trust that. Also, that I can help
                                it connecting the group and breaking down walls.</p>

                        <h2>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>

                            <p>I think it is important for me to find people whose goals align with mine in
                                some form. People that are willing to put in the work, go the extra mile, be
                                cooperative and are more inclined to mediate then cause conflict. I’m immensely
                                diplomatic in conflict situations and tend to compromise to a fault.</p>

                        <h2>Overview:</h2>

                            <p>Social justice issues and human welfare is something that has always been
                                important to me and after doing come research l have realised that there isn’t
                                an app that offers a platform for people to discuss these issues, receive news
                                and updates and express their point of view. It seems biased journalism
                                companies and sporadic, inconsistent pieces of information on social media are
                                the two main ways people get their information on what’s happening in the world.
                                Therefore, my idea is that I would like to create an app platform that allows
                                people to sign up and create their own profile with their specific views,
                                discuss it with others even though they may share a different point of view, get
                                live or daily updates on current world issues and hopefully communicate enough
                                to eventually understand one another a little better.</p>

                        <h2>Motivation:</h2>

                            <p>My motivation for this project idea is I honestly believe it is something we
                                need right now. With everything happening right now and with such high emotions
                                there isn’t a way for people to connect on one platform and talk things out,
                                receive honest information and break down walls. Communication and understanding
                                should be the main priorities right now and I would like to create a platform to
                                do that. As of the year 2000 4% of people in developing countries had access to
                                a phone, by 2015 that number increased to 94% (Abhik K Pramanik, 2017) so it
                                would offer people that live in remote, developing areas or who don’t have the
                                opportunities’ to stand up for themselves a pathway to have their voices heard
                                by people with proven interest in social issues ie: Indigenous Australians in
                                remote areas, Middle Eastern countries currently in war or famine, the
                                impoverished of the world whose governments are so corrupt they have had every
                                platform to express their opinion deleted or heavily controlled, people of the
                                Amazon protesting deforestation etc.
                                It would give them all a place to speak and be heard by people that care. Or
                                some who don’t. At least the hope is that they will listen.</p>

                        <h2>Description:</h2>

                            <p> The app would be similar to a social networking site like Facebook or
                                Discord, but the key difference would be in that the main focus of the app would
                                be on social, humanitarian related issues. The fact that it is separate from
                                other apps is important as it means the information and views are distinguished
                                from the entertainment and misleading aspects of other comparable platforms
                                It is important that it involves push notification so users are able to sort
                                through the information for what is important to them and so they are updated
                                on important news, petitions, protests etc. It should involve a “Personal Page”
                                similar to apps like Facebook and LinkedIn so users can express their views in
                                an obvious place that anyone can access.  It is also important to involve an
                                anonymous option, so people are able to express their opinions without having
                                to worry about potentially negative push back from people with opposing
                                viewpoints. One of the main features, though, is the community guidelines. Due
                                to these topics being so emotional for some people the possibility of inciting
                                violence or for discriminatory groups to gather en masse is high. The guidelines
                                should be strict on these topics and never allow potentially violent,
                                discriminatory or abusive behaviour. It is all about communicating openly,
                                without the need for anger or violence.<br></p>

                            <p> One of the key challenges would be developing the “news” stream to collect
                                information from reputable sources and display them automatically, build a
                                community guideline filter that automatically intercepts and flags all posts
                                based on content, the peer to peer communication and the encryption. These will
                                all require further training and research to develop an understanding of.
                                It is also important that the app appears professional and attractive as this
                                will influence its credibility and usability. Probably something natural. Green
                                and cream or bone colour with black or white highlights. It should have hatural
                                feeling navigation and keeping the features to a minimum. A wise man once told
                                me “It’s better to do six things a thousand times than a thousand things six
                                times” and that has really stuck with me. Don’t overdo it, focus on what is
                                important, start within our means. These are all important to get right as soon
                                as it hits the market.</p>

                            <p> Initially it will be available on the App Store and Google Play store. Its
                                further scalability is enormous though. As it gains popularity we can look into
                                other options like podcasts, user video channels, websites, merch. All of this
                                from one location.<br>
                                The app will be non-profit but potentially come with a small cost to minimise
                                ads and support future charitable and social work. There may even be the
                                possibility of contacting certain media outlets to gain sponsorship and use them
                                as key reporting outlets, depending on credibility of course.<br>
                                Initially it will be designed to appeal to millennials and younger
                                generations as they are the most involved in current social justice issues, but
                                all will be welcome.</p>

                    <h2>Tools and Technologies:</h2>
                            <p>
                                - The first and foremost necessary tool is a Mobile Phone for the user.<br>
                                - An app inventor like MIT App Inventor or something comparable.<br>
                                - Malware and encryption technologies. Anonymity is paramount.<br>
                                - A program that will find, sort through and display news to a feed.<br>
                                - A program that will sort through user comments and conversation to identify
                                    community guideline breaches and isolate them, automatically.<br>
                            </p>
                    <h2>Skills Required:</h2>

                            <p>It is absolutely necessary to be able to code well in an app format. The
                                app’s professional appearance depends completely on how well it is executed. A
                                good understanding of community guidelines and law surrounding this type of
                                platform is also immensely important as without it the potential legal exposure
                                is too high to make it worthwhile.</p>

                    <h2>Outcome:</h2>

                            <p>If this works, it could change the world. The people that feel alone, unheard or
                                misunderstood will be given a voice. The power of information will be returned
                                to the people, not the media. The issue of isolated societies and opinions will
                                be minimised. People will actually be able to change the world themselves,
                                without requiring a news media platforms support. They won’t need to worry about
                                whether the issue in their lives that is destroying them, and their families,
                                will be lucrative enough for the news companies to report on.
                                The worth of their plight won’t be based on views.
                                People will be able to communicate, educate and come together.
